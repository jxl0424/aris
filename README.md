ARIS — Autonomous Responsive Intelligence System

ARIS (Autonomous Responsive Intelligence System) is a voice-enabled AI orchestration platform designed to demonstrate how Large Language Models can intelligently coordinate tools, APIs, and memory to automate real-world workflows.

The system is engineered to showcase AI engineering capability, including:

Intelligent LLM-driven reasoning and tool orchestration

Production-aware design with safety, logging, and resilience

Automation of practical workflows

Extensible, modular architecture

Optional voice interaction

ARIS is not a chatbot.
It understands goals, plans actions, calls tools, retrieves knowledge, verifies results, and responds responsibly.

Core Capabilities
✔️ Autonomous Tool Orchestration

ARIS uses an LLM as a reasoning “brain” to:

Interpret user intent

Select appropriate tools

Plan multi-step workflows

Execute tasks safely

Recover from failures

Produce reliable final outcomes

✔️ Voice + CLI Interaction

CLI conversational interface (default)

Optional voice mode:

Speech-to-text input

Text-to-speech responses

UI-expandable design

✔️ Real-World Automation

ARIS enables:

Intelligent web search and structured analysis

Knowledge retrieval via RAG

Interaction with real APIs

Controlled task automation workflows

✔️ Engineered for Reliability

Structured tool registry

Governance and safety rules

Execution monitoring

Deterministic routing

Failure handling / retry logic

Memory & state management
